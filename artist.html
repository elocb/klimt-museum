    <h1>About Gustav Klimt</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p><strong>Gustav Klimt</strong> (1862–1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. He is best known for his highly decorative, sensual style that combines symbolism, eroticism, and the luxurious use of gold leaf.</p>

    <p>Born in Baumgarten near Vienna, Klimt studied at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts and began his career as a conventional academic painter. However, his mature work departed radically from tradition, embracing psychological depth, mythological themes, and female beauty as central elements of his art.</p>

    <p>His most iconic paintings, such as <em>The Kiss</em>, <em>Judith I</em>, and <em>Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I</em>, reflect a fascination with intimacy, desire, and the transitory nature of life. Klimt's so-called “Golden Phase” was marked by opulent compositions that combined flat patterns, mosaic-like surfaces, and richly symbolic content.</p>

    <p>Though controversial in his time for the sensuality of his subjects, Klimt left a lasting impact on modern art and design. His work continues to influence artists, illustrators, and filmmakers around the world.</p>
