    <h1>About This Project</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>This digital museum was created as part of a Digital Humanities course project. The goal was to explore how digital tools can be used to organize and present cultural artifacts in engaging and accessible ways.</p>

    <p>The focus of this virtual exhibition is the work of <strong>Gustav Klimt</strong>, one of the most iconic artists of the early 20th century. The collection brings together ten of his most well-known paintings, offering brief descriptions, historical context, and visual details.</p>

    <p>The data for this site is hosted in a collaborative <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Sheet</a> and fetched using a live JSON API. The design emphasizes clarity and simplicity, while small visual enhancements such as animations and zoom effects aim to make the user experience more engaging.</p>

    <p>This project reflects the intersection of art, history, and digital design — inviting users to explore the legacy of Klimt in a modern format.</p>
